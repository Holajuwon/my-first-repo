# my-first-repo
Github-tryout

A project worked on while using the general assembly dash's platform.

I learnt some concepts in html css and javascript

I also learnt about the use of JQUERY which is an easy method of writing javascript commands(making it shorter.)

*JQUERY ISSUES*
I had to comment out the Jquery syntax cause it was not working on github pages as I was trying to check up my work with a live page.
